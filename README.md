# Animates

For this project we used Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, Two.js, and local storage on the front-end, and Node.js, Express.js, NPM, MySql, Sequelize ORM, Handlebars, JQuery, and GIF Encoder on the backend to create an interactive drawing application. We researched and utilized a variety of technologies (listed below) in order to make the app interactive, useful, and fun. We used a collaborative approach to the creation of this app by using pair programming. We maintained an organized task flow by utilizing Github's project cards, issue submissions and branch protection rules so that we could review and approve updates to the app.
