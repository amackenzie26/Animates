# Animates

For this project we used Bootstrap, CSS, Javascript, Two.js, and local storage on the front-end, and Node.js, Express.js, NPM, MySql, Sequelize ORM, Handlebars, JQuery, and GIF Encoder on the backend to create an interactive drawing application. We researched and utilized a variety of technologies (listed below) in order to make the app interactive, useful, and fun. We used a collaborative approach to the creation of this app by using pair programming. We maintained an organized task flow by utilizing Github's project cards, issue submissions and branch protection rules so that we could review and approve updates to the app.

## App Overview

This app allows users to log in or sign up using a username and login or by providing and email and creating a username and password. Once logged in, the user may direct themselves using the navigation panel on the left. From the navigation bar the user can access the explore page in which they can make animations.
